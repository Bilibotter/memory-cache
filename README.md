# MemoryCache
This project is a lock-free, thread-safe, easy-to-use memory cache module for Go that supports generics. 
It aims to provide efficient and concurrent data storage and retrieval.
## Features
* Support caching of any type of data using generics
* Thread-safe and lock-free implementation for high concurrency
* Simple and easy to use with a clean API interface
* Support setting expiration time, and use less goroutines to clean up expired cache data

**Note1: This project includes a dedicated testing branch for running test cases. Make sure to switch to that branch for testing purposes.**
**Note2: I can only reopen a repository due to I can't fix enhance-cache's go get bug :( .**
